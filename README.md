## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher) or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (for database-related tasks)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or navigate to the desired task directory:
   ```bash
   cd Task0X
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (if required):
   - Check for `.env.example` files in respective task directories
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the task)

### Environment Setup
Some tasks require environment variables for configuration. Each task directory that needs environment variables will contain a `.env.example` file with the required configuration template. Copy this file to `.env` and fill in your values.
