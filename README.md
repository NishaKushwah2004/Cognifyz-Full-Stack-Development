### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or navigate to the desired task directory:
```bash
cd Task0X
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables** (if required):
   - Check for `.env.example` files in respective task directories
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values
   - Common variables include:
     - `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
     - `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string
     - `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT tokens
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth credentials
     - `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string

4. **Start required services** (if needed):
   - **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running (for Tasks 06-08)
   - **Redis**: Start Redis server (for Task 08)
     ```bash
     redis-server
     ```

5. **Run the server**:
```bash
npm start
```

   For development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the task)

### Environment Setup
Some tasks require environment variables for configuration. Each task directory that needs environment variables will contain a `.env.example` file with the required configuration template. Copy this file to `.env` and fill in your values.

**Important**: Never commit `.env` files to version control. Always use `.env.example` as a template.
